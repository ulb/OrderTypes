            <h2>Natural &lambda;-matrix</h2>
            <p>
                J. E. Goodman and R. Pollack proved the equivalence of &lambda;-matrices and Order Type of a point
                set in [Multidimensional sorting, 1983] and described an algorithm to compute the &lambda;-matrix of
                a labelled point set.
            </p>
            <p>
                To uniquely identify an Order Type, [Aichholtzer et al., 2001] used the &lambda;-matrix of smallest
                lexicographical order, the natural &lambda;-matrix. They used this to sort their exhaustive database
                of Order Types. To be able to compare the Order Types of two
                point sets an algorithm to compute the natural &lambda;-matrix is needed. Aichholtzer describes one
                such algorithm in the <a
                    href="http://conferences2.imfm.si/conferenceDisplay.py/getPic?picId=36&amp;confId=12">slides</a>
                of a presentation at a conference.

                The idea is the consider each point on the convex hull in turn as a pivot for a clockwise radial sort in
                order to determine a labelling of the points. For each of these labellings, the &lambda;-matrix is
                computed. A &lambda;-matrix M is an n*n matrix (where n is the size of the point set) with each entry
                M(i, j) containing the number of points that lie on the left of the ordered line through point i and
                point j. In the end, only the matrix with smallest lexicographical value is kept as the natural
                &lambda;-matrix.

        let tmpMatrix = "";
        let pivotPoint = convexHull[pivotId];

        for (let i in ordered) {
            for (let j in ordered) {
                tmpMatrix += nbPointsLeftOf(ordered[i], ordered[j], ordered);
            }
        }

            <p>
                We will now perform a quick analysis of the complexity of the algorithm presented here-above:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The complexity of computing the convex hull of n points is the complexity of the Graham Scan
                    algorithm, hence <i>O(n log(n))</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sorting the points radially around another uses the classical merge sort algorithm, hence it has a
                    complexity of <i>O(n log(n))</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Computing the &lambda;-matrix, once the points' order is set, has a complexity which is cubic in
                    number of points. This is because for each ordered pair of points we need to iterate over all the
                    other points and verify in which half-plane they are. Overall, computing this step takes
                    <i>O(n³)</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because the sorting step is dominated by the computation of the &lambda;-matrix, the total
                    complexity
                    of the algorithm is <i>O(k n³)</i>, where k is the number of points on the convex hull.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Binary Search equivalent point set</h2>
            <p>
                The order types database is exhaustive for the considered number of points, hence a guarantee is
                provided that all the possible sets of points drawn by the user, containing between 3 and 9 points, have
                a corresponding sets of points in the dataset. The entries of this dataset are ordered lexicographically
                based on their natural &lambda; - matrix, making it possible to search the database using a simple and
                efficient binary search algortihm. In such a binary search algorithm, the half of the elements to be
                searched is determined by comparing the natural &lambda; matrix of the middle element with the one of
                drawn points and the algorithm is called recursively on the newly determined half or it stops if the
                middle set of points is the desired one.
            </p>

            <h2>Load point set from the database files</h2>
            <p>
                The files of the exhaustive Order Type database contain coordinates of points encoded on 8 or 16
                bits. Multibyte coordinates are stored in Big Endian format. To load the point set at a given entry
                index we need to create points, in order, parsing the numbers in the file as their coordinates.
                An array is used to contain the coordinates instead of the raw file.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to directly access a point set corresponding to a specific Order Type, the offset inside
                the array needs to be computed first (the use of Uint8Array or Uint16Array hides the size of the
                underlying coordinates, simplifying offset computation). The position of the first point is thus
                the index of the set times the size of an entry (i.e. number of points times 2 coordinates).
            </p>

            <h2>Implementation choices</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the computational requirements imposed by the application functions, we decided to perform
                the computation on the client side, rather then the server. A second argument for this decision was
                the intent of keeping the communication with the server and the server application itself to a minimum.
                Nevertheless, the implementation is written in JavaScript, a full-stack language, hence it can be easily
                ported to the server side or in a local application, without requiring extensive modifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our second decision is with respect to dataset files used by our application: given the exponential
                increase in file size, we restricted the application to 9 points. This restriction does not affect the
                functionality, nor the scalability of the application when considering the 10 points dataset also. A
                second argument for this decision is the fact that the goal of this demo is to let the users familiarise
                themselves with the concept of order types and explore the database provided by [Aichholtzer et al.,
                2001], hence limiting the application to just 9 points does not impede on this goal.
