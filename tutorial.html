            <h2 class="bold_title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Here you will find resources to understand what order types are and how we can manipulate them to learn
                about point sets. Besides a
                tutorial, the website also provides a glossary of terms directly related to order types or that are more
                general in Computational Geometry as well as an interactive demo.</p>
            <p>The data used to compare user inputs with or to look up a property comes from the exhaustive database of
                Order Types of upto 11 points along with some properties about them provided by O. Aichholzer, F.
                Aurenhammer,
                and H. Krasser. The database can be found <a
                        href="http://www.ist.tugraz.at/staff/aichholzer/research/rp/triangulations/ordertypes/">here</a>.

            <h2 class="bold_title">Tutorial - What is an order type</h2>
            <p>In this section we want to explain in an intuitive way what order types are and how we can manipulate
                them as
                well as some of their applications.</p>
            <p>We will start by giving you the full definition and then we'll brake it down and understand it piece by
                piece.
            </p>
            <blockquote>The order type of a set {p1, p2, ..., pn} of points in general position is a mapping that
                assigns to
                each ordered triple i, j, k in {1, ..., n} the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the point
                triple pi, pj, pk.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ok, as expected, this is still a bit obscure, but it will all make sense soon!</p>
            <p>Let's start with the easy part: the point set. This really is what it sounds like; a collection of
                points.
                Consider, for example, the following point set S of 6 points in the plane.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jzmluyc6lb?embed" width="400px" height="400px"
                    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" frameborder=0></iframe>

            <p>The following concept is that of general position. This is a property that can apply to points or to
                lines.
            <ul>
                <li>For points it means that no three points in the given set can be co-linear (on the same line).</li>
                <li>Two lines that are not parallel will inevitable intersect. General position for lines simply means
                    that no
                    three lines can intersect in the same point.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The following construction shows a set of points that is NOT in general position. Adding p7 to S broke
                the
                property as it is now possible to draw a line through p3, p7 and p2.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Now, let's skip ahead a bit and talk about the orientation of a triple of points.</p>
            <p>The orientation of an ordered triple of points expresses how the third point is positioned relative to
                the
                first two. Three points p1, p2, p3 can only be in three different orientations: clockwise,
                counter-clockwise
                or aligned. The following figure shows the three options.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9g1octzxb1?embed" width="400px" height="400px"
                    style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
            <ul>
                <li>In red: p3 lies on the left of p1p2 and p1,p2,p3 form a left turn (counter-clockwise rotation)</li>
                <li>In purple: p3 is on p1p2 and p1, p2, p3 form a straight line (aligned)</li>
                <li>In blue: p3 lies on the right of p1p2 and p1, p2, p3 form a right turn (clockwise rotation)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The orientation of three points can be computed by the following matrix called Orientation Determinant.
                When
                the value of the determinant d is d&lt;0, d=0, d&gt;0 the three points form a counter-clockwise, no,
                clockwise
                rotation.</p>
            <img src="images/tutorial/odmatrix.png">

            <br><br>
            <p>Good, now we're ready to tackle the main part of the definition. </p>
            <p>The somewhat complicated formulation boils down to this: For each triple of points in the set keep their
                orientation.</p>
            <p>A more intuitive definition is a question: "In what way are the points of this set arranged relative to
                each
                other?". For example, all sets of four points fall into two order types. One point set is drawn below
                for
                each.</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dyjtki6wua?embed" width="400px" height="400px"
                    style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
            <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cnncscg1ov?embed" width="400px" height="400px"
                    style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
            <p>For size four, either the points are in the arrangement "triangle containing a point" or "no triangle
                contains another
                point". <br> For size five, the possible arrangements are a pentagon, a quadrilateral containing a point
                or a triangle containing two points. All point sets of size four or five fall into these categories,
                either directly or by symmetry.</p>
            <p>The convex hull of the point set can be triangulated in many different ways, where the other points lie
                inside these triangulations determine (modulo symmetries) different order types.</p>
            <p>This information can be used to compare different sets of points. Two sets with the same order type for
                example will have the same number of triangulations.</p>


            <h1 class="bold_title">Tutorial - Order Type Encoding</h1>
            <p>Now that we understand what an order type is we need to know how to work with them. But, how do we
                compute
                the order type of a point set to learn about its properties and compare them to that of another set. We
                need a
                way to encode Order Types.</p>
            <p>As the number of Order Types increases exponentially with the size of the set of points, efficiency is
                required.</p>
            <p>Multiple encodings exist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Triple orientation list: A literal approach would be to store for each triple of points their
                        orientation. Triples are given lexicographical order (p1, p2, p3) , (p1, p2, p4), ... This is
                        very space-inefficient.</p>
                    <p> LEFT <br> LEFT <br> RIGHT <br> ... <br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Point list: Instead of storing the orientation of triples, we could store the points themselves
                        and
                        recompute the triples when necessary. This is more compact but query times will suffer
                        greatly</p>
                    <p>0, 158 <br> 56, 301 <br> 0, 254 <br> 15, 70 <br> ...</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&lambda;-matrix: This is a matrix of size n * n (where n is the number of points) where each
                        (i,j) position holds the number of points on the left of the directed line through points i and
                        j.</p>
                    <img src="images/tutorial/lambda_matrix.png">
                    <p>This clever solution allows for a quadratic cost storage in the number of points and can be
                        compared directly with other matrices.</p>
                </li>
                <p><b>Important note:</b> For encodings where the encoding varies depending on the labeling of the
                    points, like for triple orientation or &lambda;-matrix encoding, the points are assumed to be in
                    natural ordering. This means that the lexicographically smallest resulting encoding is chosen to
                    represent the order type.</p>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <h1 class="bold_title">Interactive demo - Order Types database by Aichholtzer et al.</h1>
            <p>The exhaustive database of order types of up to 11 points and their properties is a collection of files.
                Each file describes order types or one of their properties of a particular size. The database has index
                files that are used to identify files corresponding to a specific order type.</p>
            <p>These files range from "otypes03.b08" to "otypes10.b16". They contain one point set per order type. These
                order types are sorted by natural ordering. The number before the dot represents the number of points of
                the order type and the file extension the number of bits used to save each coordinate of a point.</p>
            <p>Since the order types are sorted by natural ordering in the index files, binary search can be used to
                find the entry corresponding to a point set by comparing its &lambda;-matrix to the &lambda;-matrix of
                the point set at the currently evaluated entry. After this finding an entry containing a specific
                property of this order type can be done in constant time since it is located at the same entry offset as
                its order type in the corresponding file.</p>


            <h1 class="bold_title">Interactive demo - Computing a &lambda;-matrix of a point set</h1>
            <p>The &lambda;-matrix used to describe an order type is always the lexicographically smallest matrix
                computed on any of the labellings of the the points in the set. As the number of arrangements of n
                points (used to determine the labelling) grows with the factorial of n, it is important to have an
                efficient algorithm to compute the smallest matrix as exhaustive search quickly becomes infeasible.</p>
            <p>J. E. Goodman and R. Pollack describe an algorithm to compute the &lambda;-matrix for a specific ordering
                in [Multidimensional sorting, 1983], and the algorithm for the natural ordering &lambda;-matrix is
                described in [Aichholtzer et al., 2001].</p>
